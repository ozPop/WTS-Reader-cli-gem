# WTS-Reader-Cli-Gem

----

## Gem Overview

----

This ruby CLI gem uses native text-to-speech capabilities to read certain web pages to the user. It takes in URL as paramater or gives an option to choose a source and an artice. In either case the program returns a spoken version of the content of that URL using built in text-to-speech software.

## Installation

----

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'WTSReader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install WTSReader

## Usage

----

Run the below command and follow instructions

```
$ wts-reader
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
